## Solutions to Computational Economics and Finance Exercises in Stata and Mata
We are big fans of the book [Applied Computational Economics and Finance](http://www.abg-analytics.com/financial-economics.shtml) by Mario J. Miranda and Paul L. Fackler (MIT Press, 2002). Their book provides numerous well-designed exercises for those studying the book to solidify their understanding and work with applications. Unfortunately, the book does not come with a solutions manual. Much of the discussion in the book refers programs the authors wrote for the book in Matlab. And the book's CompEcon toolkit provides these Matlab programs, which you will find at Fackler's GitHub page and elsewhere. But we prefer to work in Stata and Mata, so we have taken on the fun challenge of adapting to methods and code for use in Stata/Mata.
## Solutions to Chapter Exercises
We'll begin posting code to this repository. For now, details and latest updates see our [Applied Computational Economics and Finance Exercise Solutions in Stata and Mata](http://www.abg-analytics.com/applied-computational-economics-finance.shtml) main page.
